The death toll of a migrant shipwreck near the southern Italian coast has risen to 61, Italian authorities said on Monday. Manuela Curra, a provincial government official, told Reuters that a new body had been found at sea after a wooden sailing boat carrying migrants to Europe crashed early on Sunday against rocks near Steccato di Cutro, a seaside resort on the eastern coast of Calabria.
