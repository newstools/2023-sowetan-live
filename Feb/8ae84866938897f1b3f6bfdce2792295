Two people drowned in rivers in Limpopo during the  floods that have plagued the province in the past week. A man, 59, attempted to cross the Selati River when he drowned on Monday. On the same day, a grade 11 pupil who was swimming in the Mmaba River  drowned, said the Limpopo department of co-operative governance, human settlements and traditional affairs (COGHSTA). “They have been reported to have drowned and their bodies were retrieved,” said spokesperson Hitekani Magwedze. Limpopo  is among  seven provinces  devastated by  floods and heavy rainfall in the past week which led the government to declare a national state of disaster on Monday. The SA Weather Service (Saws) issued a warning of continued heavy rains in Limpopo on Tuesday while the rest of the country can expect showers and thunderstorms this week. Limpopo MEC of COGHSTA Basikopo Makamu urged residents living near rivers and dams  or low-lying areas to  take extra precautions during this rainy season. “We plead with  people to avoid flooded rivers. Whether walking or driving, it is always safe to wait out these heavy rains and flooded rivers. “We are  aware that some people feel obliged to use these pools of water for religious reasons but considering the  fatal dangers at hand, we encourage you to postpone these activities,” Makamu said. Saws forecast a 100mm to 200mm rainfall accumulation in Limpopo on Monday and Tuesday. The flooding  has also forced  Kruger National Park to close some of its camps due to  dangerously high rivers. Magwedze said the rainfall has mostly affected  road infrastructure and bridges have been washed away in  Mopani, Waterberg and Vhembe districts. “These weather conditions are forecast to remain during the early part of 2023,” he said.
