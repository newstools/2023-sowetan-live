A man caught by  girls raping their nine-year-old friend was  sentenced  in the Phokeng magistrate’s court to life imprisonment on Monday. On February 2 2022, a girl was playing with friends in  the 26-year-old man's yard in Lethabong when  he called her into his room and raped her,  National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Henry Mamothame said. Evidence in  court revealed  the  girl’s friends  became worried when she did not return from the house. “They went to peep through the window. They saw  [him] on top of the  girl and went to report the matter to her mother,” Mamothame said. The mother opened a case with the police and  he was arrested the same day. He pleaded guilty to the rape, Mamothame said. “In aggravation of sentence,  prosecutor Obed Molope urged the court not to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence of life imprisonment as the offence was committed by a person who should be protecting his family environment, particularly in a time when women and children are facing high levels of abuse,” he said. When handing down the sentence, magistrate Segakweng Moeng said  the man was a father figure who abused his authority by raping a defenceless girl who was not suspicious of his intentions. North West director of public prosecutions  Rachel Makhari applauded the investigating officer, prosecutor and the  girls for their bravery in leading to the conviction. “We cannot allow such heinous crimes to destroy the lives of innocent and vulnerable children of  society, thus this conviction is welcomed,” said Makhari.
