Western Cape dam levels have  dipped below 50%, a significant decrease from 65%  this time a year ago, raising the possibility of pre-emptive water restrictions in some parts of the province. Cape Town dam  levels are slightly higher at 56.4%, but also significantly down on the  80.8% level  a year ago. The relative water scarcity follows below average rainfall  over the past few months in stark contrast to widespread flooding  in other provinces. Local government, environmental affairs and development planning MEC Anton Bredell on Monday called on municipalities to consider imposing pre-emptive water restrictions. “My department  will  engage  municipalities to assess and evaluate their water security situation. Where necessary, we will recommend  water restrictions  be implemented sooner while there are still options available,” he said. He urged municipalities to ensure their water infrastructure is well maintained to minimise leaks. Water management systems should also be optimised so all water can be accounted for. “Small individual actions, such as reusing water, can make a huge collective difference. We should always treat water as a scarce and valuable resource, irrespective of our dam levels.” TimesLIVE
