Tinseltown was abuzz this weekend as it hosted two major award ceremonies, the 54th National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) Image Awards as well as the 29th Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards. Both the yellow and red carpets displayed outstanding looks from figure-flaunting silhouettes to fabulous fashion moments. Here is a round-up of the best dressed from the NAACP Image Awards: Host of the NAACP Image Awards, Queen Latifah, stunned in four outfit changes of which our favourite was outfit number three. The burgundy couture gown was by designer Tony Ward. The Black Panther: Wakanda Forever actor was one of the stars who did double duties this weekend. Bassett stunned in a white Great Constantine jumpsuit with bellow sleeves at the NAACP Image Awards. The Grown-ish starlet was an incredible sight in a mini dress by Giambattista Valli couture. The design was ruffled at the hem and had a cape-like train with matching opera gloves. Spotted alongside  her husband Dwyane Wade, Union wore a graphic Versace gown. The Euphoria actor also had a busy weekend like Bassett. She outshone in a racy vintage Versace gown from the Italian fashion house’s 2002 couture collection that featured a plunging neckline and a centre thigh-high slit. The School for Good and Evil actor had jaws dropping in a Fendi couture gown that was cinched around her waist, complete with a draped slide slit. Washington kept her look red carpet worthy with sparkling spaghetti strap underwear and slicked back wet hair. The musician and actor looked sultry in a scarlet floor-length Cong Tri gown with a dramatic waist cut-out and thigh-high slit. Monáe wore the colour head-to-toe, matching the gown with  strappy heels and lipstick.
