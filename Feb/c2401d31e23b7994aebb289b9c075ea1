Sgt Connie Nkuna had a hectic first day in her new post at the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) as she helped deliver a baby on the side of the road in Northcliff. The incident happened on Wednesday. Nkuna, 41, was conducting crime prevention patrols with other officers when a member of the public informed them a woman was in labour at the corner of Milner Avenue and Beyers Naudé Drive in Northcliff. She and the other officers stopped to evaluate the situation. She requested the officers to go to the Roosevelt Park fire station to get assistance from paramedics. “The woman went into full labour while she awaited assistance. The baby had to be delivered with the help of Nkuna, a bystander and the mother's sister,” said JMPD spokesperson Xolani Fihla. He said the woman gave birth to a  baby girl and shortly after her delivery the paramedics arrived. According to the information provided, the mother had just got out of a taxi and was heading to Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital in Coronationville. The ambulance transported the mother and healthy newborn girl to the hospital, and they were both discharged after observation. Nkuna, who was newly promoted in the position, was serving her first day in region B, Randburg, when this incident occurred. She said she was traumatised and wondered if they were acting appropriately since it was her first encounter with a situation of this nature. When the paramedics assured her that both the mother and the infant were fine, she felt relieved. JMPD acting chief of police Angie Mokasi commended Nkuna for going beyond the call of duty by ensuring she helped the distraught mother as best as she could while serving the city  with pride and dedication. The baby girl was named Blessing after Nkuna said  her birth a blessing. TimesLIVE
