Heavy rain in KwaZulu-Natal  has led the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to cancel  its Armed Forces Day  capability demonstration. The event was scheduled from Friday to Saturday at Naval Island in Richards Bay, northern  KwaZulu-Natal. SANDF spokesperson Brig-Gen Andries Mokoena Mahapa said after consultation with relevant authorities it was  decided to cancel because of the bad weather. The persistent rain had a negative affect on  ground conditions at the Naval Island venue, making it difficult and risky for  spectators. “The weather forecast for the  next few days is  not favourable. The SANDF takes the safety of the  public  seriously and would not do anything to jeopardise it. “We did attempt to come up with an alternative date but  were advised  this would be  impractical at such short notice,” he said. SANDF chief Gen Rudzani Maphwanya apologised for the cancellation, especially to those who  had already made plans to attend. On Monday, some SANDF members were relocated to community halls after the military campsite was flooded. TimesLIVE​
