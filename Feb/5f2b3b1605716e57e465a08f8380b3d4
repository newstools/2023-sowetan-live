Certain parts of  Gauteng and Mpumalanga may experience water shortages  because of a power failure at one of Rand Water’s stations  on Wednesday. The Mapleton booster station, which is supplied by an  Ekurhuleni substation, experienced a total power failure. The substation is fed from the Eskom grid, said Rand Water spokesperson Makenosi Maroo. Ekurhuleni technicians could not find any fault on their system and therefore concluded the error came from Eskom, Maroo said. “Eskom technicians are still busy with fault finding and unfortunately the estimate restoration time is  unknown at this stage,” she said. The power failure has led to  a decline in Rand Water’s reservoirs, in particular in Brakpan, Vlakfontein and Bronberge, Selcourt, Stompies and Wildebeesfontein. Should the restoration of power be prolonged, Rand Water’s reservoirs may decline to  low levels, Maroo said. This would affect: Ekurhuleni Tshwane Govan Mbeki local municipality Lesedi local municipality Thembisile Hani local municipality “Rand Water will issue an update as soon as further details are available. Rand Water urges all consumers to use water sparingly,” Maroo said. TimesLIVE
