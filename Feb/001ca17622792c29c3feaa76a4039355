A car dealership, Telkom site and  housing complexes were among a slew of businesses and residential  estates disconnected during City Power's  revenue collection drive in Johannesburg. The drive is part of its tough stance on debt collection. City Power has targeted customers ranging from businesses, which included  a shopping centre, to key customers, government institutions  and residential homes. City Power said its operation was bearing fruit as more than R3.8bn was recovered between October and December last year. On Monday, officials descended on Midrand for a four-hour disconnection campaign that kicked off at Silver Stream Estate in Halfway Gardens, which allegedly owes the city  more than R9m. The  others are: City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena said  businesses and individuals in Midrand owed the city a combined R340m. Those disconnected on Monday had a combined electricity bill of R37m. “The entity is still owed about R7.9bn  by customers across the city,” Mangena said. “We encourage customers who are in arrears or know they have defaulted to approach our service delivery centres so that arrangements [to pay] can be made.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
