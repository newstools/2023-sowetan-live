The appeal by the ANC MP who was denied bail for allegedly killing his wife was struck off the roll by the Orkney magistrate's court on Friday. Sibusiso Kula, 34, was denied bail earlier this month but the ANC MP appealed the judgment at the North West High Court. Senior state advocate Benny Kalakgosi urged the court to strike the matter off the roll as the papers submitted by Kula’s attorney were not in order, said National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) regional spokesperson Henry Mamothamea. “Judge André Peterson ruled in favour of the state and the matter was struck off the court roll. The NPA welcomes the judge’s ruling and will now focus on building a solid case against the accused, pending the finalisation of the investigations in preparation for trial,” he said. Kula’s wife Jennifer Motlhomi was found dead in her home on  November 27 2022 after what appeared to be a robbery. She had been stabbed in the back. The murder weapon was not recovered, added Mamothame. The matter was reported to the police by the healthcare facility where Kula allegedly took her. Kula told the police he was not at home when the incident happened, said Mamothame. But thorough investigations by the police linked the ANC MP to the alleged murder. He was arrested on  February 20 2023 and charged with murder. “Police investigations are  under way and Kula will remain in police custody until the next court appearance.” Kula is to reappear in court on  March 14.
