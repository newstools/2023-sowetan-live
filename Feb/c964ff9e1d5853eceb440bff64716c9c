The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has arrested four members of the Boksburg North visible policing unit for the alleged assault and torture of a foreigner  last month. The incident is alleged to have occurred on January 9. Ipid spokesperson Lizzy Suping said the four officers were arrested at  work  on Wednesday and were detained at the Boksburg police station. Suping said the victim  and his friends were approached by the  officers who demanded to see their identity documents. “When the victim could not produce an original copy of the  documentation, he was taken to the police station where he was allegedly assaulted and tortured by the officers. The victim was taken to hospital for medical attention where he was in a coma for nine days.” The  officers, a sergeant and three constables, face charges of assault  with intent to do grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. Suping said they  would appear  in the Boksburg magistrate's court on Thursday. TimesLIVE
