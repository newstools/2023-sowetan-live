EFF leader Julius Malema has  launched another attempt to oust Tshwane mayor Randall Williams. “The mayor of Tshwane is incompetent; like [President] Cyril Ramaphosa, he must step down with immediate effect,” Malema said. He blamed Williams for problems  experienced by  residents,  including water shortages and interrupted metro bus services. “The [DA's] coalition partners must initiate a motion of no confidence if he refuses to step down and we will support,” Malema said. EFF Tshwane regional leader Obakeng Ramabodu threatened  to shut down municipal offices if Williams did not resign. Ramabodu  blamed Williams  for problems raised in an auditor-general's report, including  overpayments of councillors and officials benefiting from supply chain processes. Service delivery in the metro was not running smoothly, he said. “The  water problems in Hammanskraal are still unresolved with no tangible progress. The grounding of Tshwane bus services on Tuesday due to unavailability of diesel is a miscarriage of good governance.” The EFF,  with  other opposition parties, does not have enough votes to  oust Williams. Previous attempts to lobby DA coalition partner ActionSA fell flat in October,  despite ActionSA and the DA  being at loggerheads about an  investment offer by an  Australian company to revamp two metro-owned power substations. A vote of no confidence  will not be successful without  the support of DA coalition partners. Tshwane  council seats: — ANC: 75 — EFF: 23 — DA: 69 — ActionSA: 19 — Freedom Front Plus: 17 TimesLIVE
