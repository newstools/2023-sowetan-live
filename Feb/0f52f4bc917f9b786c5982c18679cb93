Following the recently concluded ODI series between the Proteas and England, the Betway SA20 will now take centre stage as it heads towards its business end. Over 20 players who played in the one-day series will be returning to their respective SA20 franchises and will try to adjust from 50 overs to 20 overs. Paarl Royals captain David Miller is of the view that players won’t struggle to go back to the SA20. Miller’s side will take on the Joburg Super Kings at the Wanderers on Friday at 1.30pm. “I don’t think it’s going to affect performances at all. I’m going to Joburg, it won’t be an issue because we’re playing on Friday,” said Miller this week. “This is our profession, and we are getting paid for it. You are expected to perform and be there for any team you are playing for. I think it comes with the territory and I think the guys will be up for it,” he said. The SA20 tournament has provided a lifeline for cricket in SA and is set to thrill even further as it goes to the final stages with playoff spots up for grabs. The top four teams out of the six sides will go through the semifinals next week. The Durban’s Super Giants, who have been on the back foot for much of the tournament, will be looking to revive their campaign. The Kwa-Zulu Natal outfit will host the Sunrisers Eastern Cape today at the Kingsmead Stadium (1.30pm). They will be looking to Proteas star Heinrich Klassen to hit the ground running after he was in action in the ODI series win over England. “Switching formats, we’ll see how the body holds up,” said Klassen when asked by the media about returning to the SA20 “It’s going to be tough, we have got another three games in four games. The team is struggling, we just need to keep our form and hopefully win with a bonus point or two and see what happens,” he said.
