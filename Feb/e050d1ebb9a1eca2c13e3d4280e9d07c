Springbok prop Babalwa Latsha has signed with Premier 15’s side Harlequins Women from Western Province, joining with immediate effect.

This seems to be a wonderful group of people. it’s just a great environment to thrive in as a rugby player and as a person,” she told the Quins media department “To be able to experience what it’s like to be on one of the biggest stages at The Stoop and at Twickenham is amazing, so I’m really excited to represent South African Women’s rugby but also to be in the space where I can do my thing,” she said. Quins coach Amy Turner says Latsha will be a valuable addition to their front row pack. “Babalwa is a great addition to the squad and brings a wealth of experience to the front row group. She’s a physical player who boasts a strong skillset ball in hand,” said Turner. “Her international experience speaks for itself and to have represented SA in both 15s and 7s World Cups is a testament to her versatility and skill.
