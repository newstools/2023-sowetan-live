The City of Johannesburg mayor Thapelo Amad has officially announced most of the members of the mayoral committee. However, the names of two MMCs have been omitted from the list as they still need to be sworn in as councillors in the city. In a statement, Amad said the MMCs were selected after extensive consultations with other political parties, with the aim of solidifying the government of local unity. “We are reaching out to the city's senior management team, urging them to work with the government of local unity in a cohesive and integrated manner. We must work together for and with our residents. We further urge senior management to instill professionalism and increase productivity that is performance driven. "For the city to achieve its goals, there must be alignment between the government of local unity mandate and government programmes as informed by the growth and development strategy of 2040. Our city has lost a lot of time due to indecisive leadership over the past few months. It is time for us as the government of local unity to get back to the basics and serve our residents,” Amad said. Below is the list of  City of Johannesburg's  new MMCs: Patriotic Alliance deputy president Kenny Kunene is expected to be sworn in as a councillor on Friday alongside the EFF's Ennie Makhafola.
