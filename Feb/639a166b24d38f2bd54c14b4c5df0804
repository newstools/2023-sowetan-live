The judicial conduct tribunal hearing into the conduct of suspended judge Tintswalo Makhubele has been adjourned to May 8. Evidence leaders  requested an adjournment. Makhubele is alleged to have violated the separation of powers principle by being both a judge and chairperson of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board. She is accused ofÂ  advancing corruption and state capture. On Thursday, Prasa group head for legal, risk and compliance Martha Ngoye testified at the hearing. Ngoye  said Makhubele marginalised the Prasa legal department during the extensive litigation by Siyaya entities. According to Ngoye, Prasa  ended up paying a settlement of R56m to Siyaya through a default judgment. TimesLIVE
