Porous borders, police incapability to deal with complex financial crimes, churches laundering cash, aiding terror. From churches banking more money than they collect in offerings, to a protection racket at spaza shops and explosives being transported in taxis and buses in bags across borders. This is the dark web of SAâ€™s organised crime operations, which at times are not detected due to a lack of stringent controls and monitoring of illicit financial flows. SA has a relatively high volume and intensity of crime and more than half of reported crimes fell into categories that generate proceeds. This is according to an October 2021 report by the IMF, which warned that the widespread use of cash in the informal economy had placed the country at risk. The involvement of law enforcement authorities who turn a blind eye to incidents of money laundering is fuelling the crime. According to a June 2021 report compiled by law enforcement agencies titled, coordination about anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism, there is huge corruption happening at OR Tambo International Airport in Kempton Park, on the East Rand.
