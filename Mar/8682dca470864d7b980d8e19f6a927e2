The Health Professions Council of  South Africa (HPCSA) has appealed to  striking members of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) to  act within the confines of the law. Since the wage strike started on Monday, there have been several reports  about patients and non-striking employees  being barred from accessing health facilities. “Council  condemns the behaviour  by some  striking workers, as the continuation of such acts will  affect the provision of healthcare services to the public,”  HPCSA president Prof Simon Nemutandani said. The council said it has noted with concern the  acts of violence and intimidation  at  healthcare  centres and hospitals due to the  strike. “The HPCSA has  the responsibility of ensuring the protection and safety of members of the public and healthcare workers registered with the council. “Council condemns  violent action related to the strike as they will have a negative affect on  healthcare services  provided at  hospitals by health practitioners. Workers have a right to embark on  peaceful strike action without compromising the lives and wellbeing of healthcare workers, patients and members of the public.” Provision of healthcare is an essential service and  people have the right to access basic human rights services, including healthcare services, as guaranteed by the constitution, it said.
