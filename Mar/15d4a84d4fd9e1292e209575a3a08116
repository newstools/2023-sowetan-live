Municipal spokesperson Zweli Dlamini said he only became aware of the incident on Thursday after Sowetan called him for comment. The ANC in Ekurhuleni had earlier sent out a statement about the incident. “It has been brought to my attention that the details of this heinous crime have been circulated to the media by a political party represented in council. I want to implore leaders of political parties to refrain from sharing information that is still subject to investigation in order to not muddy the waters and prejudice investigations underway by law enforcement agencies,” the city said in a statement. “Equally, it is insensitive to the families of the deceased that their rights to privacy and dignity in this painful period is infringed upon for political point scoring. I want to plead with our communities and ask that you refrain from engaging in acts of violence and vigilante justice and to allow city officials, or contractors in the employ of the city, to do their work to ensure that communities receive the services that they deserve.”
