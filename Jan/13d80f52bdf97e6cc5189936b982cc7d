After last week's Golden Globes, Hollywood A-listers once again served lewks at the 28th annual Critics’ Choice Awards’ red carpet. Hosted by comedienne Chelsea Handler at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, California, on Sunday night (Monday morning SA time), stars including Thuso Mbedu, Janelle Monáe, Tyler James Williams, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Kerry Washington, Niecy Nash-Betts, Angela Bassett, Viola Davis, Brian Tyree Henry and Quinta Brunson walked the red carpet. Here are some of our favourite looks: The SA-born star shimmered in a gold, silver and bronze sequined gown designed by Louis Vuitton. The Woman King actor paired the heavily embellished look with natural hair and minimal jewellery. This singer-cum-actor looked drop-dead gorgeous in a sheer black Vera Wang dress, with daring cut-outs in all the right places. The Abbott Elementary actor looked dapper in an AP Milan suit. The 66-year-old veteran actor smouldered in an off-the-shoulder metallic gold dress by Haiti-born designer Jovana Louis. Washington flaunted her slim figure in a strapless crystal embroidered number created by Armani Privé. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever star went Gothic in a cleavage-hugging black ruffled dress by Christian Siriano. The American writer, producer, actress and comedian looked stunning in a figure-hugging ruffled gown by London-based fashion label Robert Wun.
