The 70-year-old grandmother of a deaf top achiever is elated as a celebration event gave her the opportunity to fly in an aircraft and visit Johannesburg for the first time. Tholakele Madlala from Mbali in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal,  told TimesLIVE she was over the moon. As the caregiver of  her grandson Thando Eloka,  she attended a breakfast hosted by  basic education minister Angie Motshekga and her deputy Reginah Mhaule to honour top achievers. “I've never been on a flight and I thought I would die without having boarded one. What this child did is just too amazing!” she said. “His achievement not only made us proud as a family but it  came with a wonderful lifetime experience  we never thought we would  see or get to experience. I feel like an important person because we've been treated like VIPs since our arrival on Wednesday. I'm really happy,” she said. Another proud parent, Nelisiwe Khumalo, 56, also from KZN, said she was  proud of her son's achievement. He had been a top achiever from a young age and  she was overjoyed  that he was among the country's top achievers. “I have three other  children who matriculated and received good results, but they never got to be among the top achievers.  This is heartwarming and big for us,” the mother said. Motshekga is expected to  make the official announcements. TimesLIVE
