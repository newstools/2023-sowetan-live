ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday laid a wreath on the grave of late ANC president Zaccheus Mahabane at the Seeisoville Cemetery in Kroonstad in the Free State. Accompanying him were newly elected ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula and second deputy secretary-general Maropene Ramokgopa, among other dignitaries. The ceremony was part of the build-up to the ANC's 111th birthday celebrations on Sunday and was Ramaphosa's first public engagement since being re-elected for a second term as party president.
