The "best of friends", who have developed a reputation for fighting through their lawyers, will on Thursday morning slug it out in court. Ramaphosa is contesting Zuma's attempt to have him privately prosecuted in a case involving state advocate Billy Downer SC and journalist Karyn Maughan as an accessory after the fact. This is one of the topics that Rams Mabote discusses in this week's edition of Taking the Rams by the Horns podcast on SowetanLIVE. We also find out how government leaders are doing on the social media platform. For this topic, Rams is joined in studio by Lorato Tshenkeng, the CEO of Decode Communications, which recently released results of its survey. The research shows that messages that president dropped on Twitter were a one-way traffic as the president does not engage with members of the public on social media. In addition, Tshenkeng explains why newly-elected ANC secretary general Fikile Mbalula's number of followers on Twitter has grown while the followers of arts and culture minister Nathi Mthethwa were not growing. In fact, Mthethwa's spokesperson Masechaba Ndlovu, who recently has been tweeting about her pregnancy, is more popular than her boss on the platform. The communications expert also names cabinet ministers who are not the social media platform.​
