Golden Arrows coach Vusumuzi "Kanu" Vilakazi made a somewhat startling revelation about referee Thabo Mkhabela after their 3-1 defeat to Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. Vilakazi told journalists that Mkhabela apologised to him after the game for not awarding them a free-kick when Ntsako Makhubela, who's on loan at Arrows from Pirates for the remainder of the season, was dispossessed by Monnapule Saleng in what looked like a 50/50 challenge before Pirates' second goal, scored by Terrence Dzvukamanja, in stoppage time. "I went to the referee. I approached him nicely. I wasn't fighting him and I asked him about the [Makhubela] incident and he apologised to me. It was unfortunate that we lost the game at that moment... he apologised. I even spoke to the linesman when he said there's nothing he can do and I asked him why they have that [wireless] communication device if they can't help the referee,'' Vilakazi said. Pirates took the lead via Saleng in the 28th minute before Velemseni Ndwandwe came off the bench to net what looked to have given Arrows a crucial away point in the 68th minute. Pirates restored their parity via Dzvukamanja in referee's optional time before Vincent Pule put the game to bed two minutes later. Vilakazi was really disappointed with the officiating on the day. "We were looking like a team who will score  another goal up until that disappointing moment where the referee denied us a free-kick when Makhubela was fouled. Obviously when we are here we are here to compete,'' said the Arrows coach, who steers the Abafana Bes'thende ship alongside Mabhuti Khenyeza. "We are not looking for any favours from the referees but we still deserve justice from referees. That Makhubela incident changed the whole complexion of the game. it affected all of us psychologically but it's fine, it's water under the bridge now."
