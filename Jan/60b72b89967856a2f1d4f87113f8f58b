Criminals are again spreading fake news online about the social relief of distress (SRD) grant, trying to obtain  the personal details of vulnerable South Africans. This week, the  South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) warned of numerous scams making the rounds on social media  targeting beneficiaries of the SRD grant. One scam claimed a R700 grant was being introduced in January and applications were open. It said  more than 675,000 citizens  would receive the grant as part of Sassa's 2023 budget to support  citizens aged between 18 to 65. “Please be aware of the below fake news. Sassa does not offer such a grant. We urge our beneficiaries to protect their personal details. Do not share your ID number with strangers,” warned Sassa. Another scam making the rounds claimed Sassa has  more than 100,000 job vacancies and  is hiring  people between the ages of 16 and 35. The fake post promised job seekers  they would receive a salary  of between R176,310 to R207,681 per annum,  excluding benefits. “Please be careful of numerous fake news making the rounds on social media. When in doubt please go to your nearest Sassa office or call our customer care number. Direct people to our page for more information,” said Sassa. Last year, Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi advised people to verify  information. “When we communicate with our beneficiaries there is a proper way in which we communicate. One of  the platforms  we use is to send alerts, because we've got the addresses of individuals, so  they are able to respond,” Letsatsi told eNCA.
