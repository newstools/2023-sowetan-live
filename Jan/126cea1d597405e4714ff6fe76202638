The South African  Social Security Agency (Sassa) has assured beneficiaries  the gold payment card  remains valid. The agency said the card remains active even though is it has an  expiry date. “Beneficiaries must not panic or succumb to the hijacking by scammers and circulating fake news that the card will expire in April 2023,” it said. Sassa said  gold  cards are authentic and can be used   at Postbank, ATMs and merchants. “Beneficiaries are encouraged to provide their private bank accounts to Sassa as another option  for safe easy and payment. Sassa will in due course communicate changes if there are any. “Fraudsters who pretend to be Sassa officials and target old  people and people living with a disability  must immediately be reported to the local police,” said Sassa. This week Sassa  warned of new  fake WhatsApp messages claiming grant beneficiaries can apply for a R700 grant online without going to a Sassa office. “It’s the quickest way to apply for all bona fide citizens only who needs helping hands in their various activities [sic],” reads a WhatsApp message doing the rounds. Sassa said applicants cannot apply online for a Sassa grant because they have to collect the form, and the grant amount has not been increased. A Sassa spokesperson told TimesLIVE: “Sassa requests clients to be vigilant about misleading information, scammers and fraudsters who want to take advantage of the vulnerable and other recipients.” TimesLIVE
