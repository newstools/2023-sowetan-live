A group of more than 20 armed suspects who covered their faces with balaclavas reportedly stormed into a filling station in Graskop, Mpumalanga. The incident in one of Mpumalanga's tourist hubs occurred in the early hours  on Tuesday. Mpumalanga police spokesperson Brig Selvy Mohlala said the suspects initially posed as clients who wanted to refill at the fuel station at about   midnight. “When fuel attendants offered  assistance, the suspects reportedly held them at gunpoint  and tied all of them with cable ties. “The cashier, who was held hostage,  was reportedly ordered to show them where the drop-in-safe was. The suspects allegedly detonated explosives to open the safe and made off with an undisclosed amount of cash,” he said. According to  police, a few minutes later the suspects allegedly went to a nearby tourist centre. “The suspects allegedly held a security guard at gunpoint and also tied him with cable ties. The suspects  disabled the alarm system before accessing the building and  detonating explosives to access cash  in the safe. They made off with an undisclosed amount,” he said. Members of the public who might have information on the whereabouts of the suspects can call the Crime Stop number  08600 10111.
