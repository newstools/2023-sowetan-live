Lions coach Ivan van Rooyen says his team need to understand how to play in the windy and wet weather conditions they are experiencing in Europe. The Johannesburg side is  on a four-week tour of Europe and it has not been rosy as they have lost their opening two games on the spin. The first loss on tour was a 33-3 defeat to Munster in the United Rugby Championship last week and on Saturday they succumbed to a 17-7 loss to Stade Francais in the Challenge Cup. The tough weather conditions the Lions have found in Europe are proving to do a number on them as they can't use them to their advantage, and this has been their Achilles heel on tour. "In the second half, we couldn't manage to get out of our half against a very strong wind; either by errors or conceding a penalty. Then they got close into our 22m," said Van Rooyen after the defeat to Stade Francais. "In cold, wet and windy conditions like we are experiencing on this tour so far, we need to capitalise on playing with the wind more and find a way to gain more territory and still create attacking opportunities against the wind. We played for way too long in our own 40m from our try line in the second half," he said. The Lions  tour continues, and they will leave Paris, France, for Newport in Wales to settle in for their next match. In a crucial Challenge Cup encounter, they will face the Dragons on Saturday at Rodney Parade. Van Rooyen's team will conclude their tour on January 28 when they visit Connacht in Ireland. These two games are important in the Lions' season, good results are needed. For that to happen, the team needs to use the weather to help them in the defence and attack. "For the next two games, it is important for us to grow in those areas as both games are going to be in similar conditions," said Van Rooyen.
