Kaizer Chiefs mentor Arthur Zwane has made a big  promise regarding their title charge after missing a chance to close the gap between them and leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. With  Richards Bay and SuperSport United having  lost earlier, Chiefs had a chance to leapfrog them but failed  as they lost 1-0 to Sekhukhune United on their 53rd birthday at FNB Stadium Saturday night. It’s the second time Chiefs fail to win a game that would have made a huge difference in their title charge. In October last year, Amakhosi needed to beat Chippa United to go top of the standings but ended up being beaten 2-1 at the same FNB Stadium. Zwane has vowed enough is enough, saying it will never happen again that they fail to capitalise on such opportunities in the title race. “We saw the opportunity today and we said ‘guys most of the teams that are in the chasing pack lost and it’s an opportunity for us to climb the ladder’. It is the second time now we fail to capitalise on the defeats of other teams in the chasing pack. I don’t think it’s going to happen for the third time,” Zwane said. “I remember we lost against Chippa when we had an opportunity to go top and today again there was an opportunity to be in position two and it didn’t happen. So obviously it will happen at the right time, I believe that.” Despite the defeat to Babina Noko in their backyard, Zwane was still proud of how his boys applied themselves on the day, highlighting they picked up valuable lessons from the game, where failing to bury chances was their main undoing. Vusimuzi Mncube scored the only goal of the game, benefiting from Zitha Kwinika’s slip. “We ended up losing but [I] can’t fault  the boys. They gave their best, did everything, and from the mistake, we can only learn from our mistakes... next time we’ll maybe be able to bury the chances we’re creating, that’s why I said football can be funny sometimes,” Zwane said.
