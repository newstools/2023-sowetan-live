City Power has begun its crackdown operation in Alexandra which is aimed at cutting off electricity supply to non-paying customers. Only 4% of businesses and residents pay for electricity in Alexandra and the township owed City Power's  Alexandra depot R363m. On Tuesday morning, technicians arrived at the Engen garage near Alex Mall where they planned to terminate supply. After speaking to the manager who claimed that payment is being made by Engen, officials gave him just one day to get his documentation that proves that the account is up to date. “It is paid at the head office,” said manager  John Kalavina. But City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena said records showed that the garage owes the city about R790,000. “In the next three days we will be going for at least R36m, which is the money that is owed by mostly businesses. We will be targeting businesses today and tomorrow. From there we will be targeting residential areas. “Only 4% of Alexandra township pays for electricity, the rest are using electricity for free. We will be looking at taverns, salons, spaza shops…these are the people that make money on a daily basis. They can pay for electricity but they just decide  not to pay,” Mangena said. After dealing with business customers, the operation is expected to deal with illegal connections among residential customers. dlaminip@sowetan.co.za
