The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has warned bathers and  anglers to be cautious of a  full moon spring tide that could result in stronger rip currents. The NSRI said from Monday “high tide will gradually get higher and low tide will retreat to lower than normal leading up to the peak of the full moon Spring tide on  January 6 — a full moon micro moon.” “The concern is that  bathers and  anglers who are not aware of the full moon spring tides will be caught off guard.” The institute warned that rip currents “can be stronger in places during a spring tide”. “We  appeal to  bathers and  anglers to be cautious and bathers should only swim at beaches protected by lifeguards, swim in the safe swimming areas lifeguards post using their red and yellow flags.” The NSRI’s Mike Vonk said many of  South Africa's beaches have powerful rip currents  that can  sweep  swimmers away from the beach to behind  the surfline within minutes. “A rip current will not pull you under the water, but will pull a swimmer away from the beach. If caught in a rip the most important thing is not to panic. “Swim out of the current at 90°  to the direction in which you are being pulled and use the waves to swim back to shore. Or flip on your back and float until the current runs out of strength and you can swim back to the beach,” he said. The warning comes after five people drowned at Durban's North Beach on December 17 when they were  caught in a rip current. TimesLIVE
