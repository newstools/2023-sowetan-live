The councillor of ward 43 in Boksburg, where residents protested against ongoing power cuts, says  the city will provide them with a resolution on how to address the  outages within 14 days. On Monday, residents blocked roads with burning tyres, saying they were tired of  power cuts. Marais said she had a fruitful meeting with the residents of Klippoortjie and will return in 14 days with a plan to move forward. “Just like everyone in the country, residents are tired of the constant power cuts due to load-shedding. Residents are tired of the financial losses and restoration times,” Marais said. She  said cable theft was worsening the electricity challenges. “We will look into stepping up security to deal with cable theft. We are committed to our residents and in 14 days  will come with feedback pertaining to the energy crisis we are facing,” Marais said. She pleaded with residents to bear with the city in resolving the  crisis. “Let's stand strong and united to stop load-shedding. We need to look at renewables as we try to see how we can solve the problem,” she said. TimesLIVE
