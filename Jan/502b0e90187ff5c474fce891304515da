More than 1,400 people died on South Africa's roads over the festive season, with the highest number recorded in Gauteng, the only province to register  an increase. Transport minister Fikile Mbalula on Tuesday released the statistics for 2022/23. He revealed that 1,451 people died,  a 13.9% decrease compared to the previous year's total of 1,685. Mbalula  expressed concern at the high number of pedestrian deaths over the festive season. “Pedestrian fatalities remain a major source of concern. Pedestrian fatalities significantly increased by 10% year-on-year, from 31% in the previous period to 41%,” he said. “Simply put, out of every 100 road crash fatalities, 41 are pedestrians. In Gauteng and Western Cape, pedestrian fatalities constitute 54%, implying that of every 100 people that died from a road crash, 54 were pedestrians. “For this festive season, passenger fatalities recorded a 7% decline, with 31% recorded in the current period, compared to 38% in the previous festive season. Our message to buckle up must continue to resonate with motorists as a life-saving mechanism.” He said  unbuckled children and adults  have been flung out of cars, resulting in serious injuries and deaths that could have been prevented. The  minister  said a 6.5% reduction in fatal crashes was recorded — 1,211 this year compared to 1,295 in the previous year. According to Mbalula, most of the crashes occurred between Fridays and Sundays and from  December 15-28, when 643 people died. He gave the following provincial breakdown of road fatalities: TimesLIVE
